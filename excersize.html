<h1> MOTOGP </h1>
<p> <b> There are few finer sights in MotoGP than a stream of riders heading down the main straight at Mugello with huge crowds and the Tuscan hills as its backdrop. Owned by Ferrari, this track is enjoyed by both riders and fans alike, and is often used as a mid-season testing ground by teams and factories. Slow turns blend with fast, sweeping curves and long straights, with off-camber corners all combining to make Mugello one of the most challenging circuits on the calendar. </b> </p>
