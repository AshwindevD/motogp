<h1> MOTOGP </h1>
<p> <b> There are few finer sights in MotoGP than a stream of riders heading down the main straight at Mugello with huge crowds and the Tuscan hills as its backdrop. Owned by Ferrari, this track is enjoyed by both riders and fans alike, and is often used as a mid-season testing ground by teams and factories. Slow turns blend with fast, sweeping curves and long straights, with off-camber corners all combining to make Mugello one of the most challenging circuits on the calendar. </b> </p> 
<p> the motogp starts june 18th </p>

<hr>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>

<h3>LAP 2</h2>
<p> The old version of the Turn 10 left-hander at the end of the back straight was still in use then, meaning lap times around the current layout are not directly comparable.<br>

The purpose of the test was to help Michelin to define its tyre range for next month's Catalan Grand Prix, and therefore does not count towards riders' allocation of five private test days per year.<br>

<strong>Cal Crutchlow was quickest in the morning session aboard the LCR Honda, but was only fourth-fastest in the afternoon, 0.547s off the pace set by Vinales.</strong> </p>

<h4>QUATRO</h4>
<p> <i> It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable <sub>content</sub> of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like)</i>.</p>
